Address-of operator: the address of 

Dereference Operator: value point to by





In earlier chapters, variables have been explained as locations in the computer's memory which can be accessed by their identifier (their name). This way, the program does not need to care about the physical address of the data in memory; it simply uses the identifier whenever it needs to refer to the variable.

For a C++ program, the memory of a computer is like a succession of memory cells, each one byte in size, and each with a unique address. These single-byte memory cells are ordered in a way that allows data representations larger than one byte to occupy memory cells that have consecutive addresses.

This way, each cell can be easily located in the memory by means of its unique address. For example, the memory cell with the address `1776` always follows immediately after the cell with address `1775` and precedes the one with `1777`, and is exactly one thousand cells after `776` and exactly one thousand cells before `2776`.

When a variable is declared, the memory needed to store its value is assigned a specific location in memory **(its memory address)**. Generally, C++ programs do not actively decide the exact memory addresses where its variables are stored. Fortunately, that task is left to the environment where the program is run - generally, an operating system that decides the particular memory locations on runtime. However, it may be useful for a program to be able to obtain the address of a variable during runtime in order to access data cells that are at a certain position relative to it.

### Address -of Operator 

The address of a variable can be obtained by preceding the name of a variable with an ampersand sign (`&`), known as *address-of operator*. For example: 

This would assign the **address of variable** `myvar` to `foo`; by preceding the name of the variable `myvar` with the *address-of operator* (`&`), we are no longer assigning the content of the variable itself to `foo`, but its address.

 `  | `foo = &myvar;` |

The actual address of a variable in memory cannot be known before runtime, but let's assume, in order to help clarify some concepts, that `myvar` is placed during runtime in the memory address `1776`.

In this case, consider the following code fragment:



### Dereference operator (*)

 As just see**n, a variable which stores the address of another variable is called a *pointer***. Pointers are said to "point to" the variable whose address they store. An interesting property of pointers is that they can be used to access the variable they point to directly. This is done by preceding the pointer name with the *dereference operator* (`*`). The operator itself can be read as "value pointed to by".

Therefore, following with the values of the previous example, the following statement: 

```
baz = *foo;
```

This could be read as: "**`baz` equal to value pointed to by `foo`**", and the statement would actually assign the value `25` to `baz`, since `foo` is `1776`, and the value pointed to by `1776` (following the example above) would be `25`.

![](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/dereference_operator.png)

baz is equal to the value pointed to by foo

*foo refers the value stored by the address 1776

It is important to clearly differentiate that `foo` refers to the value `1776`, while `*foo` (with an asterisk `*` preceding the identifier) refers to the value stored at address `1776`, which in this case is `25`. Notice the difference of including or not including the *dereference operator* (I have added an explanatory comment of how each of these two expressions could be read): 

``` 
baz = foo;   // baz equal to foo (1776)
baz = *foo;  // baz equal to the value point to by baz
```

The reference and dereference operators are thus complementary.

& is reference operator can be read as "address of " * is dereference operator can be read as "value pointed to by"

The address obtained by * can be dereferenced with &

```
myvar = 25;
foo = &myvar // assign variable foo the value of &myvar, 

myvar == 25
&myvar == 1776 // assign myvar the address of 1776, (address of operator)
foo == 1776
*foo == 25 // foo equal to value pointed to by 25
```





```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  int firstvalue, secondvalue;
  int * mypointer; //deref

  mypointer = &firstvalue;     // assign the address of firstvalue to mypointer
  *mypointer = 10; 				// the VALUE POINT TO BY MYPOINTER is assigned a value of 10.
  mypointer = &secondvalue; 	// assign the address of secondvalue to mypointer 
  *mypointer = 20; 				// the VALUE POINT TO BY MYPOINTER is assigned a value of 20
  cout << "firstvalue is " << firstvalue << '\n';
  cout << "secondvalue is " << secondvalue << '\n';
  return 0;
```

Then, **the value pointed to by** `mypointer` is assigned a value of `10`. Because, at this moment, `mypointer` is pointing to the memory location of `firstvalue`, this in fact modifies the value of `firstvalue`.

In order to demonstrate that a pointer may point to different variables during its lifetime in a program, the example repeats the process with `secondvalue` and that same pointer, `mypointer`.





```
// more pointers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  int firstvalue = 5, secondvalue = 15;
  int * p1, * p2;

  p1 = &firstvalue;  // the address of firstValue is assigned to p1
  p2 = &secondvalue;  // the address of secondValue is assigned to p2
  *p1 = 10;          // value pointed to by p1 is assigned with a value 10
  *p2 = *p1;         // value pointed to by p2 = value pointed to by p1
  p1 = p2;           // p1 = p2 (value of pointer is copied)
  *p1 = 20;          // value pointed to by p1 = 20
  
  cout << "firstvalue is " << firstvalue << '\n';
  cout << "secondvalue is " << secondvalue << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```



Notice that there are expressions with pointers `p1` and `p2`, both with and without the *dereference operator* (`*`). The meaning of an expression using the *dereference operator* (*) is very different from one that does not. When this operator precedes the pointer name, the expression refers to the value being pointed, while when a pointer name appears without this operator, it refers to the value of the pointer itself (i.e., the address of what the pointer is pointing to).

Another thing that may call your attention is the line:
