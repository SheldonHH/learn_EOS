- ### Function templates

  Function templates are special functions that can operate with 

  generic types

  . This allows us to create a function template whose functionality can be adapted to more than one type or class without repeating the entire code for each type.

  In C++ this can be achieved using 

  ### template parameters

  A template parameter is a special kind of parameter that can be used to pass a type as argument: just like regular function parameters can be used to pass values to a function, template parameters allow to pass also **types** to a function. These function templates can use these parameters as if they were any other regular type.

  The format for declaring function templates with type parameters is:

  â€‹

  ```C++
  template <class identifier> function_declaration;

  template <typename identifier> function_declaration;
  ```

  Here we have created a template function with `myType` as its template parameter. This template parameter represents a type that has not yet been specified, but that can be used in the template function as if it were a regular type. As you can see, the function template `GetMax` returns the greater of two parameters of this still-undefined type.

  To use this function template we use the following format for the function call:

  `function_name <type> (parameters);`
  For example, to call `GetMax` to compare two integer values of type `int` we can write: 



```c++
template <class myType>
   myType GetMax (myType a, myType b) {
   return (a>b?a:b);
}
```
